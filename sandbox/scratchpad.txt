For file/directory, both should have:

isFile()
isDirectory()

For both the object and as static methods. So you can easily do File.isFile("/tmp") and get false

This way when you do Directory.list("/tmp") as a static (or non-static) and get a list back you can either do:
if(typeof i=="Directory")
or you can just do
if(i.isFile())
