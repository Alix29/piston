Implement the JSEDDebugVariable and JSEDDebugValue
Part of me thinks this should be on demand.
When each one is requested, go out and get the rest.
So when creating need name, type, value, hasChildren
I guess that's it rofl

Rename. Maybe LoganDebugger?

Support removal and modification of breakpoints

JS_Enumerate needs some special care when being used. I'm not doing this care right now. See docs on JS_Enumerate for details

The jsed plugin should find two available local ports at random and send both to loganmonkey on start
These are the ports that should be used for this debug instance. This allows multiple debuggers to run at once.
