#summary Details of the protocol between debugger and javascript

= Introduction =

This page details the protocol used to communicate between the eclipse debugger and the javascript app.

When I refer to 'debugger' I'm talking about the Eclipse Debugger Plugin.
When I refer to 'piston' I refer to the javascript app (pistonmonkey in this projects case)

= Overview =

It starts in Eclipse:
  # Menu: Run->Debug Configurations...
  # Right click on 'Piston Compatible App' on the left and choose 'New'
  # Give it a name
  # Browse to where the piston binary is at
  # Browse to the JavaScript file you want to start debugging in is at

When you hit 'Debug' it will launch the piston app as: pistonmonkey --enableDebugger <js file>

At this point the debugger waits for piston to start up.
Piston will start up and thanks to the --enableDebugger flag it will listen on port 7580

Once the debugger see's that piston is listening on 7580 the debugger will continue starting up.
The debugger will tell piston which breakpoints are already set.
The debugger listens on port 7570.
The debugger then tells piston that it's done and debugging can begin.

piston then executes the javascript file it was told to execute.
When any breakpoints are encountered it will let the debugger know.
Likewise when a breakpoint is reached and you hit step over, or continue, etc. in the debugger, the debugger will send those messages to piston.

= Details =

The protocol the two use to communicate is very basic. It's somewhat REST like.

Each 'message' has a name and a set of values which are POST'ed to a URL.
http://localhost:7580/messageName

Although we use a 'POST' the actual content isn't form URL encoded right now.
It's just a bunch of \n seperated values (with a trailing \n)

|| *Message Name* || *Sent From* || *Parameters* || *Description* ||
|| breakpoint_set || debugger || `<filename>\n<line num>\n` || Sent whenever a breakpoint is set in the debugger. When the debugger first starts it will send one of these for each pre-existing breakpoint before launching ||
|| start || debugger || || Sent when the debugger is done setting initial breakpoints and wants piston to start executing javascript ||
