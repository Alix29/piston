piston is a server side javascript implementation (using spidermonkey/tracemonkey).

It also includes en Eclipse debugger plugin for setting breakpoints/stepping through javascript code.

I couldn't come up better name so I just picked 'piston'.

**WARNING** I created piston and the debugger to meet my own needs. It was never intended to be a project to be consumed by others. However there was interest in the code so I am sharing it.
